# Basejump CLI
Generate new basejump projects from the command line. Also provides a few generator functions for helpful models and components while building.

## Setup
1. Install the package globally: `yarn global add @usebasejump/cli` or `npm install -g @usebasejump/cli`
2. Run `basejump` to see the available commands

Alternatively, you can run `npx @usebasejump/cli` to run the CLI without installing it globally.
